## 🚀 Motivation
Loan defaults significantly impact financial institutions and lending platforms. Accurate early prediction helps in:

- Reducing credit risk  
- Improving loan approval decisions  
- Reducing NPAs  
- Enhancing portfolio quality  

This model leverages **demographics, loan details, and credit bureau history** to predict the likelihood of default using machine learning, reducing manual evaluation errors.

- Marital_status  
- Employment_status  
- Income  
- Number_of_dependants  
- Residence_type  
- Years_at_current_address  
- City, State, Zipcode  

---

### 2️⃣ Loan Details
- Loan_id  
- Loan_purpose  
- Loan_type  
- Sanction_amount  
- Loan_amount  
- Processing_fee  
- GST  
- Net_disbursement  
- Loan_tenure_months  
- Principal_outstanding  
- Bank_balance_at_application  
- Disbursal_date  
- Installment_start_dt  
- **Default (Target Variable)**  

---

### 3️⃣ Credit Bureau Data
- Number_of_open_accounts  
- Number_of_closed_accounts  
- Total_loan_months  
- Delinquent_months  
- Total_dpd

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

### 1️⃣ Handling Outliers
Outliers in financial variables can mislead the model.

Example rule applied:


---

### 2️⃣ Encoding Categorical Features
One-hot encoding was applied to:

- Loan_purpose  
- Loan_type  
- Residence_type  
- Gender  
- Employment_status  

---

### 3️⃣ Feature Engineering

| Feature Name               | Description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| loan_to_income            | Loan amount ÷ customer income |
| delinquency_ratio         | (Delinquent months ÷ total loan months) × 100 |
| avg_dpd_per_delinquency   | Total DPD ÷ delinquent months |
| loan_purpose_encoded      | Encoded loan purpose values |
| residence_type_encoded    | Encoded residence type values |

These features significantly improved model performance and credit-risk interpretability.

### 4️⃣ Missing Value Treatment
- Missing `Residence_type` values filled with: `"Owned"`  
- No major missing values in other fields  

---

## 🤖 Models Tried
- Logistic Regression (Baseline)  
- Logistic Regression + RandomizedSearchCV  
- XGBoost Classifier  
- **Logistic Regression + SMOTETomek + Optuna (Final Model)**  

---

## 📈 Results – High Performance Metrics
- **ROC AUC:** ~0.98  
- **Gini Coefficient:** ~0.96  
- **KS Statistic:** ~85–86 *(Excellent)*  
- **Recall for Default Class:** ~0.94  

The model is optimized to detect **high-risk borrowers** with strong discrimination capability.
